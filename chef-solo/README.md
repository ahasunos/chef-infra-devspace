# chef-solo

chef-solo is a legacy tool used to run Chef cookbooks in a standalone mode, without needing a Chef server. It is useful for quick testing, one-off configurations, or simple setups.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: chef-solo is deprecated in favor of chef-client in local mode (--local-mode or -z).

chef-solo -c solo.rb -j node.json
